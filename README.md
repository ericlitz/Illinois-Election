# Illinois-Election-2018
2018 general election results by precinct for the four Illinois election rated as tossups or leans by Cook Political Report.
Looking to use these results to find themes and use those to win elections for Democrats in Illinois in the future.

I have also started a project drawing precinct level maps of these districts using geojson.  The first one that I have completed is located in the 13th congressional district folder.
